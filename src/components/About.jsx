            My job portfolio looking like a colourful mix. After school I went
            to military service for a couple of years. Then I started to study
            social sience at the university of Rostock. But I heard a call for
            manual work, so I decide to become a destiller. Yup, I can destille
            booze ðŸ¥ƒ.

            So why coding now? I was always tempted to code, but I never know
            how to start. But then a live changing event occured. I packed my
            things and went on that journey.
